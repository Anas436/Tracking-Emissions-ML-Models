# Tracking-Emissions-ML-Models

## Overview

This tutorial explains the methodology behind calculating computing-related GHG emissions from training machine learning models and demonstrates some strategies to reduce a model's carbon footprint.

Specifically, you will learn how to:

Measure a ML model's emissions with CodeCarbon
potentially reduce a ML model's carbon footprint during training

## Target Audience

This tutorial is intended for experienced and aspiring data scientists looking for concrete examples of how to track carbon emissions while executing code and how to train machine learning models in a more efficient way. The reader should understand the basic mechanics of training an ML model, such as splitting data between train and test sets and tuning hyperparameters.


## Software Requirements

This notebook requires Python >= 3.7. The following libraries are required:

- tqdm
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pytorch
